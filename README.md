# Classification of clothes using Neural Networks

This project was completed in week 9 of the Data Science Bootcamp at Spiced Academy in Berlin.

## Description
I used the [Fashion MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset, which contains 60,000 images of clothing items from 10 categories (e.g. T-shirts, boots, sandals, trousers). The goal was to classify these images in the correct category, using neural networks.

## Models
- [Artificial Neural Network](https://github.com/lorenanda/fashion-mnist/blob/main/Fashion_MNIST.ipynb) 88.07% accuracy.
- [Convolutional Neural Network](https://github.com/lorenanda/fashion-mnist/blob/main/FashionMNIST_CNN.ipynb) 90.69% accuracy.
